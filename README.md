Gherkin language support in Atom
================================

Provide syntax highlight for gherkin language files (.feature) in Atom for English and German.

Forked from gigapixel/atom-language-gherkin at GitHub. Added german keywords, added missing english keywords (regarding to cucumber/gherkin), and changed support.class.gherkin to variable.class.gherkin for better visibility.
